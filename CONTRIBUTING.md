# Contributing to the Guide to Allyship

I'm excited that you're interested in contributing. I started this project out of frustration and it has grown into a tool that people have found so much value in.

It's amazing to see people like yourself interested in helping curious people become better allies. If you're not a member of an underinvested community, working on this project with me is one way to work on your skills as an ally. I'm open to suggestions and feedback, so please don't hesitate to share.

Please make sure to review the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/almnt/guide-to-allyship/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Testing Locally

This project uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator.
It can be installed (globally) using the `npm` JavaScript package manager using
```
npm install -g @11ty/eleventy
```
Once installed, you can build an auto-updating version of the site using
```
npx eleventy --serve
```
from the base directory. The Terminal output will show where it is being hosted
(the default local is `http://localhost:8080`). Use `Cntrl+C` to exit the build.
You can read more about Eleventy in [their documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to the project](https://github.com/almnt/guide-to-allyship/pull/new/master) detailing what you’ve changed in the guide. Please use the [Gitmoji convention](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/about) for commit messages. Your commit messages should be in present tense. For small changes, one-liners are okay. Larger changes should have more details about the work you did.

Thanks so much,
Amélie
