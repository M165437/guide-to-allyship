# Contributing to the Guide to Allyship

I'm excited that you're interested in contributing. I started this project out of frustration and it has grown into a tool that people have found so much value in.

It's amazing to see people like yourself interested in helping curious people become better allies. If you're not a member of an underinvested community, working on this project with me is one way to work on your skills as an ally. I'm open to suggestions and feedback, so please don't hesitate to share.

Please make sure to review the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/almnt/guide-to-allyship/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to the project](https://github.com/almnt/guide-to-allyship/pull/new/master) detailing what you’ve changed in the guide. Please use the [Gitmoji convention](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/about) for commit messages. Your commit messages should be in present tense. For small changes, one-liners are okay. Larger changes should have more details about the work you did.

Thanks so much,
Amélie
