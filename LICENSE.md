# License and Usage

**March 15, 2021 Update**
While the guide has held an open source license to date, my intention was to create equitable access for the most vulnerable individuals and not-for-profit educational purposes. Many individuals have offered financial support as thanks for the tremendous emotional and physical labor I’ve put into this guide.

Unfortunately, as with many things, for-profit corporations have exploited my free labor for everything from company-wide trainings, workshops, and even books on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). To date, none of these corporations have paid me for the learnings they've profited off of using this guide. As such, I am amending the license to require payment if you plan to use this guide for any and all corporate or commercial usage.
